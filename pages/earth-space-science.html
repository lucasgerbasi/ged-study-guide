                <h3>I. Earth’s Structure and Geology</h3>
                <h4>1. Layers of the Earth</h4>
                <p><strong>Crust</strong>: The thin, outermost layer composed of solid rock. It is divided into two types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Oceanic Crust</strong>: Thin and dense, made mostly of basalt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continental Crust</strong>: Thicker and less dense, made mostly of granite.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Mantle</strong>: The layer beneath the crust, composed of semi-solid rock that flows slowly over time. It is responsible for plate tectonics.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Upper Mantle</strong>: Contains the lithosphere and asthenosphere, which allow for the movement of tectonic plates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lower Mantle</strong>: Denser and extends deeper into the Earth.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Outer Core</strong>: Made of liquid iron and nickel, it creates Earth’s magnetic field through convection currents.</p>
                <p><strong>Inner Core</strong>: Solid and composed of iron and nickel. It is extremely hot but remains solid due to immense pressure.</p>

                <h4>2. Plate Tectonics</h4>
                <p><strong>Tectonic Plates</strong>: Large pieces of Earth's lithosphere that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Divergent Boundaries</strong>: Plates move apart, often creating mid-ocean ridges and volcanic activity (e.g., the Mid-Atlantic Ridge).</li>
                    <li><strong>Convergent Boundaries</strong>: Plates move toward each other, often causing mountain ranges, earthquakes, and volcanoes (e.g., Himalayas).</li>
                    <li><strong>Transform Boundaries</strong>: Plates slide past each other, leading to earthquakes (e.g., San Andreas Fault).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Earthquakes and Volcanoes</h4>
                <p><strong>Earthquakes</strong>: Sudden shaking of the Earth’s surface caused by the release of energy from tectonic plate movements. Measured on the Richter scale.</p>
                <p><strong>Volcanoes</strong>: Openings in the Earth’s crust through which molten rock, ash, and gases escape. Types of volcanoes include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shield Volcanoes</strong>: Broad, with gentle slopes, formed by fluid lava (e.g., Mauna Loa in Hawaii).</li>
                    <li><strong>Stratovolcanoes</strong>: Steep, formed by explosive eruptions (e.g., Mount St. Helens).</li>
                    <li><strong>Cinder Cone Volcanoes</strong>: Small, steep-sided, formed by explosive eruptions of tephra.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Rock Cycle</h4>
                <p><strong>Igneous Rocks</strong>: Formed from the cooling and solidification of molten rock (e.g., granite, basalt).</p>
                <p><strong>Sedimentary Rocks</strong>: Formed by the compression and cementation of sediments (e.g., limestone, sandstone).</p>
                <p><strong>Metamorphic Rocks</strong>: Formed from the transformation of existing rock under heat and pressure (e.g., marble from limestone).</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Evaporation</strong>: Water from oceans, lakes, and rivers turns into water vapor and rises into the atmosphere.</li>
