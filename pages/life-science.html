                <h3>I. Cell Structure and Function</h3>
                <p>Cells are the basic building blocks of life, and understanding their structure and function is fundamental for life science.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prokaryotic Cells</strong>: Simple cells without a nucleus. Example: bacteria.</li>
                    <li><strong>Eukaryotic Cells</strong>: More complex cells with a defined nucleus and organelles. Example: plant and animal cells.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>1.2 Organelles and Their Functions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nucleus</strong>: Contains the cell's genetic material (DNA) and controls cell activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mitochondria</strong>: Produce energy through cellular respiration (the "powerhouse" of the cell).</li>
                    <li><strong>Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)</strong>: Smooth ER makes lipids; rough ER has ribosomes for protein synthesis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ribosomes</strong>: Synthesize proteins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Golgi Apparatus</strong>: Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for transport.</li>

                    <li><strong>Meiosis</strong>: Cell division that produces reproductive cells (gametes: sperm and eggs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Cellular Respiration</strong>: The process by which cells generate energy (ATP) from glucose and oxygen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Photosynthesis</strong>: Process by which plants convert sunlight, water, and CO2 into glucose and oxygen.</li>
                </ul>

                            <li><strong>Dominant Alleles</strong>: Only one copy is needed for the trait to be expressed (e.g., "T" for tall).</li>
                            <li><strong>Recessive Alleles</strong>: Both copies must be present for the trait to be expressed (e.g., "t" for short).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
