            <div class="study-guide">
                <h3>1. Basic Geographic Concepts</h3>
                <p><strong>Geography:</strong> The study of the Earth’s physical features, climates, and human populations, as well as the interactions between humans and their environment.</p>
                <p><strong>Physical Geography:</strong> Focuses on the Earth’s physical features, such as landforms, climate, ecosystems, and resources.</p>
                <p><strong>Human Geography:</strong> The study of human populations, cultures, economies, and interactions with the environment.</p>
                <p><strong>Maps and Cartography:</strong> The science and art of mapmaking. A map is a visual representation of the Earth's surface. Key map types include political maps (showing borders) and physical maps (showing landforms, bodies of water, and natural features).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Latitude and Longitude:</strong> Latitude lines run parallel to the equator, while longitude lines run from the North Pole to the South Pole. Together, they provide coordinates for locating places on Earth.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Physical Features of the Earth</h3>
                <p><strong>Landforms:</strong> The Earth’s physical features include mountains, valleys, plains, plateaus, deserts, and hills.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mountains:</strong> Large landforms that rise prominently above their surroundings, typically with steep slopes and significant elevation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plains:</strong> Large, flat, or gently rolling areas of land, often used for agriculture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deserts:</strong> Dry areas with little rainfall, supporting only limited vegetation and wildlife.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Water Bodies:</strong> Includes oceans, seas, rivers, lakes, and wetlands, which are essential for human survival, agriculture, and trade.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Oceans:</strong> The largest bodies of water that cover most of the Earth's surface (Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic, Southern).</li>
                    <li><strong>Rivers:</strong> Major waterways such as the Nile, Amazon, and Yangtze, which provide freshwater for millions of people.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Climate and Ecosystems</h3>
                <p><strong>Climate:</strong> The long-term weather patterns in a particular region, influenced by factors such as latitude, altitude, and proximity to water bodies.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Equator:</strong> The imaginary line around the middle of the Earth. Regions near the equator tend to have warm climates year-round.</li>
                    <li><strong>Polar Regions:</strong> Areas near the North and South Poles characterized by very cold temperatures.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Types of Climate Zones:</strong> Tropical, temperate, arid, polar, and highland are common climate zones that affect agriculture, population density, and lifestyle.</p>
                <p><strong>Ecosystems:</strong> Communities of living organisms and their physical environment. Different ecosystems are found across the world, such as forests, deserts, grasslands, and wetlands.</p>

                <h3>4. Population and Urbanization</h3>
                <p><strong>Population Distribution:</strong> The spread of people across the world. Population density refers to the number of people living in a given area, which can vary greatly between regions.</p>
                <p><strong>Urbanization:</strong> The movement of people from rural areas to cities. This trend has increased globally, leading to the growth of large metropolitan areas.</p>
                <p><strong>Migration:</strong> The movement of people from one place to another. People migrate for reasons such as economic opportunity, political instability, environmental factors, and conflict.</p>

                <h3>5. Global Economic Systems and Resources</h3>
                <p><strong>Global Trade:</strong> The exchange of goods and services between countries. Trade is influenced by geographical factors such as location, natural resources, and infrastructure.</p>
                <p><strong>Natural Resources:</strong> Resources that come from the Earth and are used by humans. This includes water, minerals, oil, forests, and fertile land.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Renewable Resources:</strong> Resources that can be naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, and water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Renewable Resources:</strong> Resources that cannot be replenished in a short time frame, such as fossil fuels and certain minerals.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Economic Development:</strong> The process by which a country improves the economic, political, and social well-being of its people. This can be measured by indicators such as GDP, literacy rates, and life expectancy.</p>

                <h3>6. Major World Regions</h3>
                <p><strong>North America:</strong> Includes the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The region has a diverse climate and economic systems, with strong economies based on technology, industry, and agriculture.</p>
                <p><strong>South America:</strong> Known for its rainforests (e.g., Amazon), diverse ecosystems, and emerging economies, such as Brazil and Argentina.</p>
                <p><strong>Europe:</strong> Includes countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Russia. Europe has a mix of developed and developing economies, with a long history of political and cultural influence.</p>
                <p><strong>Africa:</strong> Home to diverse cultures, languages, and ecosystems, Africa has a mix of developing economies and is rich in natural resources like gold, diamonds, and oil.</p>
                <p><strong>Asia:</strong> The largest continent, with countries like China, India, and Japan. Asia has rapidly growing economies and is home to the world’s largest population.</p>
                <p><strong>Australia and Oceania:</strong> Includes Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific island nations. Australia is an industrialized nation, while many Pacific island nations face challenges related to climate change.</p>

                <h3>7. Environmental Issues</h3>
                <p><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns due to human activity, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture.</p>
                <p><strong>Deforestation:</strong> The clearing of forests for agriculture, logging, and urbanization, leading to loss of biodiversity and contributing to climate change.</p>
                <p><strong>Pollution:</strong> The introduction of harmful substances into the environment, affecting air, water, and soil quality. Major sources of pollution include industrial activities, transportation, and waste disposal.</p>

                <h3>8. Global Conflicts and Cooperation</h3>
                <p><strong>International Organizations:</strong> Groups that promote cooperation between countries, such as the United Nations (UN), World Trade Organization (WTO), and World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
                <p><strong>Conflicts:</strong> Political, economic, or military disagreements between countries that can lead to wars, territorial disputes, or sanctions.</p>
                <p><strong>Peacekeeping:</strong> Efforts by international organizations to maintain peace and resolve conflicts, often through diplomatic negotiations or peacekeeping missions.</p>

                <h3>9. Geography and Global Issues</h3>
                <p><strong>Globalization:</strong> The process by which businesses and other organizations develop international influence or start operating on an international scale. Globalization has affected trade, culture, and technology.</p>
                <p><strong>Resource Distribution:</strong> The uneven distribution of resources around the world. Some regions are rich in natural resources, while others lack access to essential resources, leading to disparities in development and quality of life.</p>
