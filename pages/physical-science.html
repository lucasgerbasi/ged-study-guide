                <h3>I. Matter and Its Properties</h3>
                <p>Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. Understanding the properties and behaviors of matter is essential for Physical Science.</p>
                <h4>1. States of Matter</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Solid</strong>: Has a fixed shape and volume. Molecules are tightly packed and vibrate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Liquid</strong>: Has a fixed volume but no fixed shape. Molecules are close but can move past each other.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gas</strong>: Has neither fixed volume nor shape. Molecules are far apart and move freely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plasma</strong>: An ionized gas, found in stars and lightning.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Changes in Matter</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical Changes</strong>: Changes in appearance, but not composition (e.g., melting, freezing).</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Changes</strong>: Result in the formation of a new substance (e.g., rusting, burning).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>II. Atomic Structure and the Periodic Table</h3>
